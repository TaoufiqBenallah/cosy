Hello Edris AHMADY,

I have checked the project, it seems like the Docker file uses a base image that is in RBI servers, we can't control or make edits in this file.

The rest of the file just copies the projects folders into the image and nothing seems to be related the versions having issues mentionned above.

I don't see how this can be fixed with development.
